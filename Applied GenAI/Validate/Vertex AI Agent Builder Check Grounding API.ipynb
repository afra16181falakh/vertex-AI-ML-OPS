    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools for generating human-like text, but they can sometimes generate inaccurate information. To ensure your LLM provides grounded and factual responses, you need to provide it with relevant context.  Retrieval augemented generation (RAG) help [find the relevant context](../Retrieval/readme.md) and [Ranking](../Ranking/readme.md) can help filter and sort the retrieved context. But how can you be sure the LLM is actually using that context effectively?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where the Vertex AI Agent Builder [Check Grounding API](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/check-grounding) comes in. This API helps you analyze how well an LLM's response is grounded in the context you provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: You provide the Check Grounding API with the LLM's response and the context chunks you included in the prompt.\n",
    "- Analysis: The API breaks down the LLM's response and maps phrases to supporting evidence within the context.\n",
    "- Output: The API returns a detailed report, including:\n",
    "    - Citations: Links between specific phrases in the response and the supporting context.\n",
    "    - Support Score: An overall score (0 to 1) indicating how well the response is supported by the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Check Grounding API enables you to build more reliable and trustworthy LLM applications. You can use the support scores and citations to:\n",
    "- Set thresholds for response quality: Ensure that only factually grounded responses are provided to users.\n",
    "- Trigger advanced prompting techniques: If a response is poorly grounded, automatically retrieve additional context or reword the question to improve accuracy.\n",
    "- Gain insights into LLM behavior: Understand how the LLM utilizes context and identify areas for improvement in your prompting strategy.\n",
